## Introduction
Welcome, I'm Ian! I graduated from the University of Washington with a major in BS Informatics along with concentrations in data science and biomedical health informatics. I grew up just outside of Seattle, Washington. If I come across something I find interesting, I'll post it on this site.

If you need to contact me, please use one of the links in the sidebar. Feel free to send me a message or leave a comment.

## Why does this site exist?
I like creating things. Project write-ups, code snippets, and documentation of various hobbies are a few of things you might see on here. I believe it would be great to consolidate some of the cooler things Iâ€™ve created and done on this website. Writing about my projects and hobbies for a broader audience helps me consolidate my understanding and allows others to benefit from my experiences and insights and to keep a running log so I can look back at what I've been doing and learning. On this blog, I share insights into my tech/programming endeavors, reflective essays on personal growth, and creative explorations. Whether it's a new project, a DIY craft, or a random thought, I aim to capture the essence of it here.
