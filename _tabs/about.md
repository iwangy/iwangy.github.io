## Introduction
Welcome! I'm **Ian.** I graduated from the University of Washington with a major in Informatics with concentrations in data science and biomedical health informatics. I grew up just outside of Seattle, Washington. If I come across something I find interesting, I'll post it on this site.

If you need to contact me, please use one of the links in the sidebar. Feel free to send me a message or leave a comment.

## Why does this site exist?
I enjoy creating and sharing my work. On this blog, you'll find project write-ups, code snippets, and documentation of my various hobbies. This site is a place to showcase some of the cool things I've done and what I've been up to. Writing about my projects and hobbies helps me consolidate my understanding and keep a log of what I've been learning. Here, I share insights into my tech and programming endeavors, reflective essays on personal growth, and creative explorations. Whether it's a new project, a DIY craft, or a random thought, I aim to capture its essence here.
